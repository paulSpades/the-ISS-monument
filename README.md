Current Document \(EN\): document.md

## J. Current document maintainer

This document and associated repository is maintained as a well behaved Open Source Software Project.

The document maintainer claims no moral authority and only acts as a willing and flawed participant of Humanity. 
Authority to approve changes to this document in a centralized manner is a necessary evil that will be removed once more effective alternatives are found or proposed. The current document maintainer is willing to relinquish the burden onto any organization or person capable of performing the task better. 

The document maintainer will never benefit financially from distribution of this document and willingly sacrifices time and effort to maintain and improve the document repository. Any and all changes of the current document maintainer or to the document may not change this fact or this paragraph in the document. The document maintainer may not publicize or promote any other project, service, product or organization unless they obviously and directly benefit the creation of The ISS Monument. 
The role of document maintainer will be the resposibility by The Council once it is officially elected.
