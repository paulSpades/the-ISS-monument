    Definitions

  <p>
    We are nobody. We are everybody. We are every conscious mind, aware of the tragedy of losing a significant and unique artefact of Humanity's achievements. We are every soul not yet aware of this tragedy, and every unborn child with a curious mind. We are every life lived and lost on the path of Humanity's exploration of the unknown, in Humanity's pursuit for knowledge, and in Humanity's struggle for peace. 
    <br>
    We differ in skin colour, age, education, nationality, location, language, race, sex and religion. We hold many views on many other matters. We are alive, dead and unborn. We are only united in this moment by our list of demands that We wish to make clear (<a href="#B">section B</a>).
    <br>
    We will be known in this document as "Humanity", "We" and "Us".
  </p>
  <p>
    The target of our demands is currently known as "The International Space Station", also abbreviated in the document as "The ISS". This document's goal, Humanity's goal in this respect, is to preserve and protect The ISS, which will become "Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space", also mentioned in this document as "The ISS Monument". 
    <br>
    Other definitions of entities will be made in the relevant sections of this document.

  <h2> <a href="#B">B.</a> 
    What We demand
  </h2>
  <p>
    ALL of the following demands We consider MORAL, JUST and WORTHY of Humanity's attention. We will not rest while ANY of them are ignored and denied.
  </p>

  <h3 id="B1"> <a href="#B1">1.</a>
    We demand that The ISS's retirement from active service and crewed missions be the first day of its inauguration as Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space, and immediate preparations for its preservation and protection be made. 
  </h3>

  <h3 id="B2"> <a href="#B2">2.</a>
    We demand that The ISS not be destroyed willingly or through inaction. We will not allow it to be destroyed.
  </h3>

  <h3 id="B3"> <a href="#B3">3.</a>
    We demand the immediate ceasing of any plan to destroy The ISS. Any entity's interference in our goal to create, preserve and protect The ISS Monument We consider IGNORANT, IMORAL, MALICIUS and VIOLENT towards Us, and committing A Crime Against Humanity. 
  </h3>

  <h3 id="B4"> <a href="#B4">4.</a> 
    We demand moral retribution against any and all entities that interfere with our plan for The ISS Monument. This interference We consider a Crime Against Humanity. We will pursue moral retribution regardless of the constraints of international and national law, and We seek to change those constraints to benefit our plan for The ISS Monument.
  </h3>

  <h3 id="B5"> <a href="#B5">5.</a>
    We demand that The ISS Monument be recognized as the propriety of Humanity, and not of any other single or collective entity. 
  </h3>

  <h3 id="B6"> <a href="#B6">6.</a> 
    We demand that The ISS Monument be created, preserved, protected and funded accordingly, regardless of any diplomatic, political, financial and legal constraints artificially imposed by any and all other entities.
  </h3>

  <h3 id="B7"> <a href="#B7">7.</a> 
    We demand that the process of creating, preserving and protecting The ISS Monument be transparent and all relevant documents and media be made publicly accessible by any interested person or group, and never be subjected to artificial constraints imposed by any and all other entities.
  </h3>

    Document changes 
  </h2>
  <p>
    The legal and moral arguments and the plan outlined for the creation, preservation and protection of The ISS Monument can change, only if the changes benefits the achievement of ALL of our demands.
  </p>
  <p>
    The national, international, legal and commercial entities that We forward these demands to and mention in this document can change, only if the changes benefits our plan for The ISS Monument and the achievement of ALL of our demands.
  </p>
  <p>
    The list of demands can never be changed in spirit, number of items and essential meaning of the content in each item. This list of demands is the glue that ties Us together, it openly defines the necessary conflict to achieve the creation and preservation of The ISS Monument, and it is the foundation on which this document's moral authority stands.

    <h3> <a href="#D1">1.</a>
      Stop all plans involving The ISS's destruction
    </h3>
    <p>
      We consider that neither the US Congress or NASA have the authority to decide the fate of The ISS after active service, following this document. Trough this document We claim moral authority and propriety of The ISS Monument for Humanity.
      <br>
      Any and all entities involved in the current plan to de-orbit The ISS must cease all operations involving their current plans. 
      <br>
      If they refuse to comply with our demands and refuse to align with Us, they will be considered a malicious entity towards Humanity, both collectively and individually. Individuals involved have the moral duty to seek the alignment of their group/organization with Us or leave the group/organization.

    <h3> <a href="#D2">2.</a>
      Official recognition of Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space
    </h3>
    <p>
      The United Nations, UNESCO and other relevant international bodies must officially and publicly ratify this document as "Humanity's clear and unambiguous intention to preserve The ISS" and recognise Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space as a monument of significant cultural and historic value for all of Humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the current UN Council, or other responsible organisations have objections to the outlined plan, they will be taken into consideration as document changes only if the changes benefits our plan for The ISS Monument and the achievement of ALL of our demands.
      <br>
      If they deny, ignore or seek to change any of Humanity's demands, We will dismiss them as not having the moral authority to decide on the matter of preserving and protecting The ISS. They will be considered a malicious entity towards Humanity, both collectively and individually. Individuals involved have the moral duty to seek the alignment of their group/organization with Us or leave the group/organization.

    <h3> <a href="#D3">3.</a>
      Necessary actions for the creation of The ISS Monument
    </h3>
    <p>
      We elect ESA and JAXA to assemble a council that organizes funding, research, debates technical proposals and solutions and puts into practice the technical plan to preserve The ISS and create The ISS Monument. 
      <br>
      Humanity's current proposal is to boost The ISS to a higher and stable orbit. 
      <br>
      The exact parameters of this orbit, technical solutions and planned missions to achieve the effective preservation of The ISS will be elaborated, debated and publicly documented by this council. The council entity will be referred to as "The Council" in this document. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council must allow smaller aligned organizations (e.g. the NSS, other civilian national space agencies, universities, other space related associations and groups) and commercial entities(e.g. SpaceX, ULA, Northrop Grumman, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab or others) with technical expertise or relevant systems to submit proposals for mission planning, technical solutions and launch systems. 
      <br>
      The Council will maintain a public registry of proposals and all relevant proposals must be debated for their merits within The Council. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The best set of compatible proposals originating from within and outside of The Council will be selected as "The Current Technical Plan for the ISS Monument", also referred to as "The Current Technical Plan". 
      <br>
      The Council will update and periodically publish The Current Technical Plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      CNSA and Roscosmos are not included in the plan outline because they are not civilian entities. All space agencies that have strong ties to a national military are excluded and considered opposed to Humanity's efforts for peaceful space cooperation. 
      <br>
      NASA is excluded because The United States of America does not currently maintain sincere and non-threatening diplomatic relations with The People's Republic of China and Russian Federation, which We also consider opposed to peaceful space cooperation. NASA is also guilty of putting forth the current plans and funding to destroy the ISS, which We consider malicious towards Humanity. 
      <br> 
      These three entities We consider ignorant or malicious due to their current alignment with our goals, but their status and alignment with Humanity's will on this matter may change over time. We also recognise their past achievements benefiting Humanity. 
      <br> 
      As such, they will not be denied or ignored if they choose to align with Us, or if they choose to interfere with Us.

      Proposed timeline
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Council is officially assembled and starts work on The Current Technical Plan for the ISS Monument. The Council approves Partners and starts acquiring funding.
      </li><li>
        The Current Technical Plan for the ISS Monument is periodically updated, as outside proposals are debated and approved. The final planning and contracts must be agreed upon by The Council 2 years before the planned decommissioning of The ISS.
      </li><li>
        The Current Technical Plan for the creation of The ISS Monument is put into action. Any failures to this plan will be evaluated and The Council will act to resolve them.
      </li><li>
        Following the successful creation of The ISS Monument, ESA and JAXA will assemble a dedicated "Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team" to insure the continued protection of The ISS Monument. 
      </li><li>
        The Council will be automatically dissolved 3 years after The ISS Monument is successfully created and in a stable orbit. Already approved missions and proposals can continue until funding runs out. 
      </li><li>
        The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team is responsible for the maintenance and security of The ISS Monument.
      </li>

  <article id="D5">
    <h3> <a href="#D5">5.</a>
      Funding for The ISS Monument
    </h3>
    <p>
      No funding will be acquired until the official approval of the ESA and JAXA appointed council. All funding for the The ISS Monument will be directed to and controlled by The Council trough whatever means or financial entities are required. 
      <br>
      Any and all interested entities in gathering funds for the creation, preservation and protection of The ISS Monument must be approved by The Council as "Partners". 
      <br>
      No profit making ventures can be approved by The Council, except for exclusively and directly funding The ISS Monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funding needs to also cover a reasonable list of possible failures of The Current Technical Plan and the planned solutions for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council must seek and provide Partners to fund The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team for the foreseeable future, before the end of the Council's term.

    <h3> <a href="#D6">6.</a>
      Supervision and authority
    </h3>
    <p>
      ESA and JAXA have the authority and responsibility to appoint/elect/assemble The Council and The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council has authority to decide on all matters regarding The ISS Monument, excluding the list of demands We have made, but including the plan outlined in this document.
    </p>
    <p> 
      All members of The Council are required to understand and initially follow the latest version of this document. The Plan section outlined in this document serves as general guideline for The Council's work and decisions.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Transparency in the decisions made by The Council is required, and they will be made publicly accessible. 
      <br>
      Humanity sees, and The Council only serves Us. If The Council does not perform its duties, it will be dissolved and another formed by Us trough different means.
