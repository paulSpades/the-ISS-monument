# Humanity's clear and unbiased intention to preserve The ISS: The International Space Station becomes Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space

## A. Definitions

We are nobody. We are everybody. We are every conscious mind, aware of the tragedy of losing a historically significant monument of Humanity's achievements. We are every soul not yet aware of this tragedy, and every unborn child with a curious mind. We are every life lived and lost on the path to Humanity's expansion into the unknown, and in Humanity's hunger for knowledge.
We differ in skin colour, age, education, nationality, location, language, race and religion. We are alive, dead and unborn. We are only united here by these demands.
We will be known in this following document as "Humanity", "We" and "Us". 

The target of our demands is currently known as "The International Space Station", also abbreviated in the document as "The ISS". This document's goal, Humanity's goal in this respect, is to preserve and protect The ISS - which will be known as, and mentioned in the document as: "Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space" and "The ISS Monument".

Further definitions of relevant entities will be made in this document.

## B. We Demand

ALL of the following demands We consider MORAL, JUST and WORTHY of Humanity's attention. We will not rest while ANY of them are ignored.

### 1. We demand that The ISS's retirement from active service and crewed missions to be the first day of its inauguration as Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space, and immediate preparations for its preservation and protection be made. 

### 2. We demand that The ISS not be allowed to be destroyed in whole or in part, but preserved and protected as Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space, following active service.

### 3. We demand that The ISS Monument be the propriety of Humanity and not of any other single or collective entity. 

### 4. We demand the immediate ceasing of any plan to destroy The ISS. Any entity's interference in our goal to create, preserve and protect The ISS Monument We consider IGNORANT, IMORAL, MALICIUS and VIOLENT towards Us, and committing A Crime Against Humanity. 

### 5. We demand moral retribution if any entity successfully interferes in our plan for The ISS Monument. This interference We consider a Crime Against Humanity. Moral retribution will be pursued regardless of the constraints of international and national legal frameworks, while We also seek to change these constraints to further our plan for The ISS Monument.

### 6. We demand that The ISS Monument be created, preserved, protected and funded accordingly, regardless of any diplomatic, political, financial and legal constraints artificially imposed by any and all entities.

### 7. We demand that the process of creating, preserving and protecting The ISS Monument be transparent and all relevant documents and media be made publicly accessible by any interested person or group, subject to no artificial constraints imposed by any and all entities.



## C. Changes

The legal framework proposed and plan for funding sources, tutelage, maintenance, preservation and protection of The ISS Monument are subject to changes, but We will maintain and achieve ALL of the demands put forth. 

The international, legal and commercial entities that We forward these demands to and mention in this document can change, only if the changes favour our plan for The ISS Monument and We achieve ALL of the demands put forth.

Any and all changes to this document can only be made to improve the plan for The ISS Monument and We achieve ALL of the demands put forth. This means that the list of demands will not be changed in spirit, logic, number of items and item content, but may inevitably suffer from unintended translation inaccuracies. 

## D. The Plan

### 1. Stop all plans involving The ISS's destruction
We consider that neither the US Congress or NASA have the authority to decide the fate of The ISS after active service, following this document. We stake our claim.
Any and all entities involved in the current plan to de-orbit The ISS must cease all operations involving their current plans. 
If they refuse to comply with the demands put forth, they will be considered a malicious entity towards Humanity.

### 2. Official recognition
The United Nations, UNESCO and other relevant international bodies must officially and publicly ratify this document as "Humanity's clear and unbiased intention to preserve The ISS" and recognise Humanity's Monument for Peaceful Cooperation in Space as a historic monument of interest for all of Humanity.

If the current UN Council, or other organisations contacted, disagree or have any objections to the plan, they will only be taken into consideration in document changes as long as ALL of the demands are achieved. 
If they disagree or seek to change any of Humanity's demands, they will be dismissed as not having the moral authority to decide on the matter of preserving and protecting The ISS, and they will be considered a malicious entity towards Humanity. 

### 3. Technical and organisation efforts for creation of The ISS Monument
We elect ESA and JAXA to organize a council that debates, elaborates and puts into practice the technical plan to preserve The ISS, following its retirement from active use. 
Humanity's current proposal is to boost The ISS to higher orbit. 
The exact parameters, missions and funding needed to achieve preservation of The ISS Monument will be debated by this council, officially formed and delegated by the ESA and JAXA. This council entity will henceforth be referred to as "The Council". 

The Council must also allow smaller interested organizations (e.g.. the NSS, smaller civilian national space agencies, universities, other space related associations and groups) and commercial entities(e.g.. SpaceX, ULA, Northrop Grumman, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab or others) with technical expertise or relevant systems to submit proposals for mission planning, technical solutions and launch systems. The Council maintains a public registry of proposals and they must be debated for their merits within The Council. The best compatible proposals originating from within and outside The Council will be selected as "The Current Technical Plan for the ISS Monument" and "The Current Technical Plan". 

The Council is responsible for acquiring sufficient funding, itself and trough their Partners, for The Current Technical Plan to be financially feasible.
The Council is responsible for acquiring Partners to fund The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team.

CNSA and Roscosmos are not included in the plan because they are not civilian entities. All space agencies that have strong ties to national militaries are excluded and considered opposed to Humanity's efforts for peaceful space cooperation. NASA is excluded because The United States of America does not currently maintain adequate diplomatic relations with The People's Republic of China and Russian Federation. NASA is also guilty of putting forth the current plans and funding to destroy the ISS, which We consider malicious towards Humanity. 
These three entities We consider ignorant or malicious due to their current alignment with our goals, but their status and alignment with Humanity's goals may change over time or completely differ in other contexts. We also recognise their past achievements benefiting Humanity.

### 4. Timeline

1. The Council is officially and publicly elected and starts work on The Current Technical Plan for the ISS Monument. The Council approves Partners and starts acquiring funding.
2. The Current Technical Plan for the ISS Monument is updated as outside proposals are debated and approved. The final planning and contracts must be agreed upon by The Council 2 years before the planned decommissioning of The ISS.
3. The Current Technical Plan for the creation of The ISS Monument is put into action. Any failures to this plan will be evaluated and The Council will act to resolve them.
4. Following the successful creation of The ISS Monument, ESA and JAXA will assemble a dedicated "Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team" to insure the continued protection of The ISS Monument. 
5. The Council will be automatically dissolved 3 years after The ISS Monument is successfully inaugurated and in a stable orbit. Already approved missions and proposals can continue until funding runs out. 
6. The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team is responsible for the maintenance and security of The ISS Monument.

### 5. Funding
No funding will be acquired until the official approval of the ESA and JAXA appointed council. All funding for the The ISS Monument will be directed to The Council by whatever means or financial entities are required. 
Any and all interested entities in gathering funds must be approved by The Council as "Partners". 
No profit making ventures can be approved by The Council, except for exclusively and directly funding The ISS Monument.
Funding needs to also cover a reasonable list of possible failures of The Current Technical Plan and the solutions for them.
The Council must seek and provide Partners to fund The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team for the foreseeable future, after the end of the Council's term.


## F. Supervision and Authority
ESA and JAXA have the authority and responsibility to appoint The Council and The Monitoring and Maintenance Technical Team.
The Council has authority to decide on all matters regarding The ISS Monument, excluding the list of demands We have made, but including the plan in this document. 
All members of The Council are required to understand and initially follow this document and approved changes to it. The plan section outlined in this document serves as a starting point for The Council's work and decisions. 
Transparency in the decisions made by The Council is required, and they will be publicly accessible. 
Humanity sees, and The Council only serves Us. If The Council does not perform its duties, it will be dissolved and another formed by Us trough different means.
